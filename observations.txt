a. Observation: With a small block size (4 bytes), cache lines are efficiently used, and spatial locality is well-exploited.
b. - Larger caches tend to reduce miss rates as more data fits in the cache.
        - High-locality traces show better improvements, while random-access traces show smaller gains.

c. - Small block sizes may increase miss rates, while larger block sizes reduce them due to spatial locality.
        - Too large a block size causes cache pollution, increasing miss rates for traces with low spatial locality.
